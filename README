Find your fastest mirror. Usage:

./pingtest.sh [number-of-pings]

Pingtest all the ubuntu mirrors, determine the fastest one.

One day I realized my mirror was slow, and I couldn't find an easy way
to find the fastest mirror, so I wrote a script to do it. Might be
better to time wget-ing a small .deb, but this is good enough.
