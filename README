Find your fastest mirror. Usage:

./pingtest.sh [number-of-pings]

Pingtest all the ubuntu mirrors, determine the fastest one.

One day I realized my mirror was slow, and I couldn't find an easy way
to find the fastest mirror, the official 'find the fastest mirror
automagically' thing didn't work for some reason, so I wrote a script
to do it. Might be better to time wget-ing a small .deb, but this is
good enough.

This is not good code or easy to understand or anything, but I don't
want to spend too much time on it.
